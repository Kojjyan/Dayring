### DayRing — Project Summary

**Platform:** Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)
**Category:** Time Visualization / Productivity Overlay
**Slogan:** Visualize a guilt-free and grounded day

**Core Concept:**
DayRing is an always-on-top desktop app that visualizes the user’s waking hours as a circular annulus. Portions of the day are color-coded by tasks, with elapsed time greyed out. Users can track and plan their day visually and intuitively.

**Key Features:**

1. **Startup & System Tray**

   * Launches minimized to system tray on startup.
   * Persistent background process unless disabled/exited.
   * Tray menu: Enable/Disable toggle, Configure Your Day.
   * Double-click tray icon → Configure flow.

2. **Onboarding**

   * Step-by-step, single-question flow:
     0. Welcome →

     1. Wake time
     2. Sleep time
     3. Time awareness (daily awake hours)
     4. Buy Me a Coffee (shown only when opening Configure from tray).

3. **Annulus Overlay**

   * Represents waking hours only, positioned top-right by default.
   * Top of annulus = wake time; full circle = sleep time.
   * Current time indicated with radial line.
   * Elapsed time is greyed.
   * Smooth fade-in on first appearance.

4. **Configure Window**

   * Adjust annulus size, opacity (0–100%, default 80%), position, and rotation.
   * Hover near annulus → opacity +20% max 100%, task labels fade in.
   * Task editor: add, delete, color, and blend tasks.
   * Validation icons for overlapping/out-of-bounds tasks.
   * Color customization: unallocated time, passed time, and palettes.
   * Manual drag + 9 screen anchor presets.

5. **Task Defaults**

   * Breakfast 8:30–9:00, Lunch 12:00–12:30, Dinner 18:00–18:30
   * Tasks automatically sorted chronologically.

6. **Interaction Notes**

   * Numeric rotation input (0–359°), wake/sleep aligned to top.
   * Configure window shows Buy Me a Coffee screen first when opened from tray.

**Goal:** Provide a visually intuitive tool for tracking, planning, and understanding daily time use.
