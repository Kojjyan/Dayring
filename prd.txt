The app launches minimized to the system tray by default.

No windows are shown on startup.

The app runs persistently in the background unless explicitly disabled or exited by the user.

2. Onboarding Flow

The onboarding experience is presented as a single-question-at-a-time flow, with Step 0 as a welcome screen. Navigation:

Important Behavior Note:

This screen does NOT appear on app startup.

This screen appears only as a precursor to the Configure window when the Configure window is opened from the system tray.

Every time the user opens the Configure window from the tray, this screen is shown first.

3. Default Overlay (Annulus)

After onboarding completes (or the Configure window is used), an annulus (ring) with a border fades into view.

Position & Appearance

Default position: Top-right corner of the screen

The annulus represents the user’s daily waking hours only

The annulus has:

A visible border

Smooth fade-in animation on first appearance

Time Mapping

The top of the annulus represents:

The wake time

The sleep time (same point, completing the cycle)

A radial line intersects the annulus perpendicularly to indicate the current system time

The portion of the annulus representing elapsed time is:

Greyed out by default

(Note: “top of the annulus” refers to the visual top position, not a literal clock-face 12 o’clock time.)

4. System Tray Interaction
Tray Icon Behavior

The app lives in the system tray at all times when running.

Right-Click Menu Options

Enable / Disable (toggle)

Configure Your Day

Additional Access

Double left-clicking the tray icon opens the Configure flow (Buy Me a Coffee screen → Configure window)

The Configure window is the central control panel for the app.

Header Section

App logo and/or app name

Opacity slider for the annulus:

Range: 0%–100%

Hover behavior:

When the cursor is near the annulus:

Effective opacity becomes min(user_setting + 20%, 100%)

Task labels fade in next to their corresponding annulus segments

Annulus Size Adjustment

Users can adjust the overall size (diameter) of the annulus.

Important constraint:

The annulus grows inwards as size increases to ensure it does not clip or extend off-screen.

Represents the remaining waking time in the day
